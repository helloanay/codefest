#### Overview

Pehel India as an all in one social work platform, where people can contribute their skills, old items, money and get connected with NGOs, and it's a place for people who are interested in such stuff to come together and form a community and they earn rewards while doing it!

Ex:

People were joking on reddit, about there being a fire in the amazon rain forest, people literally tweeted it to Jeff Bezos asking if his company was on fire and yes, a lot of people were not aware about it and a lot of people wanted to help, but none knew what to do?

Well pehelindia, also has a update platform, where ngo's and social workers can update the current situations, and norms for the people who want to contribute to such cause, and hence it eliminates the problem of awareness in harsh situations.
